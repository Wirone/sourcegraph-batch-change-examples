# in Markdown files.
on:
  - repositoriesMatchingQuery: whitelist OR blacklist lang:markdown -file:vendor repo:sourcegraph

# In each repository
steps:
  # find all *.md or *.markdown files, that are not in a vendor or node_modules folder, and replace the terms in them
  - run: |
      find . -type f \( -name '*.md' -or -name '*.markdown' \) -not -path "*/vendor/*" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" |\
      xargs sed -i 's/whitelist/allowlist/g; s/blacklist/denylist/g'
